lirc gpio IR support for picoreplayer 2.0 squeezelite ONLY.  Does NOT work with Jivelite at the moment.

Supported actions are

Power

Play

Pause

Next Track

Previous Track

Volume Up

Volume Down

To have the Pause action work reliably, you need to be running squeezelite v1.8.1-704 or higher.

The latest build for picoreplayer can be downloaded using the picoreplayer web gui.


A slimdevices/logitech remote is the default and already configured.

If you are using a squeezebox remote, create an empty .lircrc file


touch /home/tc/.lircrc


and skip to the Add lirc-rpi module section.


If you want to use a different remote you need to replace /usr/local/etc/lirc/lircd.conf with the config for your remote.  There are many lirc remote configurations available from http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/

Add usr/local/etc/lirc/lircd.conf to the end of the file /opt/.filetool.lst

Create the mapping file for your remote.

See /usr/local/share/lirc/files/lircrc-squeezebox for an example.

You'll need to copy this file to /home/tc/.lircrc and update the remote and button values for your remote.

A big shout out to JackOfAll for the squeezebox remote lirc configuration files and Steen for the rpi irda kernel modules tcz files.  Thank you!


Add the lirc-rpi module to /mnt/mmcblk0p1/config.txt


sudo mount /mnt/mmcblk0p1

dtoverlay=lirc-rpi,gpio_in_pin=25

sudo umount /mnt/mmcblk0p1


I'm using the IR header on the IQaudIODAC which is gpio pin 25

Change the "25" to the gpio in pin you have your IR receiver diode connected.


Copy these files to /mnt/mmcblk0p2/tce/optional

Add lirc.tcz to the end of /mnt/mmcblk0p2/tce/onboot.lst


Add to one of the User commands fields on the tweaks page in the web gui.


/usr/local/sbin/lircd --device=/dev/lirc0


Add -i to the Various input field on the Squeezelite settings page.


Save your configuration and reboot.
